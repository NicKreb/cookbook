################## Recipe Book Project ##################

This recipe book should have very similar functionality compared to the blog project we made.

* The app should have access to the MongoDB cluster krebMenu in the KrebCookbook collection

* The app should be able to create and delete recipes from the recipe book

* The app should have a drop down menu that allows for one to find a recipe without scrolling down

* The app should have pages for Home, About me, and New recipes

* The create recipe fields should include the following:
    > Title
    > Prep Time
    > Cook Time
    > Flavor Profile(s) [spicy, bitter, sour, sweet, savory]
    > Ingredients
    > Cooking Instructions

* The app should be able to create recipes and upload them to the KrebCookbook Database

* The app should be able to delete recipes and remove them from the KrebCookbook Database

* We should have a chef crab mascot for the website, and styling should look clean with a sutable color arrangement for styling.
